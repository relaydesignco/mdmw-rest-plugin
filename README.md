# MWDW Wordpress Rest API Setup Plugin

This Wordpress plugin sets up the necessary custom post types and adds ACF fields to those endpoints in the Wordpress Rest API.

It also sets up a couple custom endpoints, but they are not currently being used on the front-end.

The front-end of this website is Statically-Generated Vue JS app using Nuxt.

The repo for the Nuxt app is [here](https://github.com/relaydesignco/design-week-2020-nuxt).
